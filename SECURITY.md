# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Because we still are not at v1, all releases that are not the latest are not supported. If there is a vulnerability in any of these releases, see the security section below, 
and we will make sure to publish an advisory for anyone using the release. 

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest   | :white_check_mark: |
| < latest   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
