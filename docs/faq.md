## Why is creamcrop in alpha?

As you might have noticed, creamcrop is still in alpha, as [according to the SemVer specification](https://semver.org), releases with a major release less than 1 are considered to be in alpha. We still have a lot to improve on, and, we're nowhere close to what we want to be our v1.

?> You can help out in the dev process by contributing to the [repo](https://github.com/creamcropdev/creamcrop)

Infact, here's a list of things we want to get done before we release `v1`:

- [x] ~Multiple RSS feeds~ 
- [ ] Better websites
- [x] ~Config files~
- [ ] Fast. Fast. Fast. (ie. We want it to be faster.)
- [ ] Filters
- [ ] Git tracking
- [ ] Additional Feed types - atom, JSON
- [ ] Probably a whole lot of bug fixes
- [ ] and other things we haven't thought about yet.
